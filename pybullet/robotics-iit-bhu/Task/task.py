Task -

A car is loaded. You have to develop a PID controller for that car such that it runs along the circular track.
The trajectory of the track is given by x^2 + y^2 = 3^2
Calibrate the PID gains such that car follows the line without much disturbance.

INSTRUCTIONS -
    Select the simulation window and Press ENTER to execute

# Declaring the Trackbars, use this to tune your PID.

''' Remember trackbars can only set integer values, therefore after getting values from these trackbars,
  using cv2.getTrackbarPos(), you might have to scale up or down these values appropriately. 
 For eg. If your I gains are found to be in the range of 0 - 0.1, you will scale down the I values by 10,0000.
 For more information on trackbars, refer OpenCV documentation.
