***As they say, all good things come to an end, but importantly you learn and you cherish. We hope it's been an awesome journey for all of you. We certainly had lot of fun teaching you
guys, all kinds of interesting stuff, and it's always pleasure interacting with you all.***

***Presumably, you have learned a lot of things, implemented your unique ideas, test-drived all the codes that we had made available, and ofcourse
making silly mistakes and getting frustrated for the entire day.*** 

***We've all been there, and that's how you step through the ladders of any new field of technology.***

# Task

***However, nothing ever comes without a challenge and so do we!***

***We have a simple task put together to test out, everything that you have learned and possibly to learn more.***

## Description

* **A car is loaded onto an arena. You have to develop a PID controller for that car such that it runs along the circular track.**
* **The trajectory of the track will be a circle, given by x^2 + y^2 = 3^2**Z
* **Calibrate the PID gains such that car follows the track without much disturbance.**
* **A template codee has been given, where you have to implement the task. The code contains detailed instructions and a few hints to help your way out.**

## Submission

* **You will have 1 week to present a working simulation, make sure there are no errors.**
* **All the details regarding submission of the task, will be informed later.**

## P.S

***We want you to understand, that the goal of the task is not to be the most perfectly working model, or getting the highest scores in evaluation. This often leads to either directly copying
from other resources, or feeling dissapointed with yourself for not reaching anywhere. Instead we want you guys, to have a taste of the action, have fun working out and brainstorming
through the difficulties and most importantly enjoy yourself,teach yourself. We encourage you to do your best and incase you need any help, feel free to reach out to us !***
