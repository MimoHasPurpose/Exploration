## Introduction

Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries, making it a great tool for both beginners and experienced developers. This repository provides a collection of examples, tutorials, and exercises to help you get started with Pygame and improve your skills.

## Features

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Simple examples to help you understand the basics of Pygame.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to build small games and applications.
- **Advanced Topics**: Explore collision detection, animations, and more.
- **Customizable**: Modify the examples to suit your needs and creativity.

## Installation

To use Pygame, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to install Pygame:

1. Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install Pygame:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

4. Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    python -m pygame --version
    ```

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s a simple example to create a Pygame window:

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
pygame.display.set_caption("Pygame Practice")

# Main game loop
while True:
     for event in pygame.event.get():
          if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()

     # Fill the screen with a color
     screen.fill((0, 0, 255))

     # Update the display
     pygame.display.flip()
```

Save this code in a `.py` file and run it to see a blue window.
